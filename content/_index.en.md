## Who I am

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Augsburg, at the Institute for Materials Resource Management.
My focus is on sensor and software development for combining different sensors into one system.

I studied Physics for Bachelor and Master at the University of Augsburg.
Since 2017,  I'm working on my PhD at the working group [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/mntf/mrm/prof/mech/), Institute for Materials Resource Management, University of Augsburg.

Besides that, I'm quite good at nerding out about coffee.
My favorite way of brewing is a V60 or a chemex.
But a also love making a cappuccino with my espresso machine, a Rancilio Silvia, which I programmed to have a PID temperature controller and connected it to Siri via the Home Bridge.
