[{"content":"I am a PhD candidate working at the University of Augsburg, at the Institute for Materials Resource Management. My research topic is on combining multiple acoustic structural health monitoring methods in a combined sensor system. I developed a new ultrasonic sensor that is able to measure these different methods and built a MATLAB software framework to enable a realtime monitoring system for structural health monitoring of industrial machines, especially milling machines.\nMy mentor is Prof. Dr. Markus Sause.\nExperiences # Academic Biography #  Since 2017: PhD Engineering, University of Augsburg  Thesis: Combined structural health monitoring with acoustic methods in a sensor network   04/2015 \u0026ndash; 09/2017: M.Sc.
